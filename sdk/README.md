# SDK

Use the Openos SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Openos Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/solana-program) instead.

More information about Solana is available in the [documentation](https://docs.openos.info/).

The [Openos Program Library](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
